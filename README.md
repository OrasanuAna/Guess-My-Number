# Guess My Number

**Guess My Number** is an interactive game developed with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, where the player has to guess a number between 1 and 20. With each attempt, the game provides feedback on the guess, guiding the player towards the correct number.

## Description

The player’s goal is to guess the randomly chosen secret number between 1 and 20. After each guess, the app gives hints like "too high" or "too low" and adjusts the score accordingly. The game continues until the player guesses correctly or the score reaches zero.

### Features
- Feedback for each guess:
  - "Too high" – if the guessed number is higher than the secret number.
  - "Too low" – if the guessed number is lower than the secret number.
  - "Correct number" – if the guessed number matches the secret number.
- Adjustable score displayed in real-time.
- Option to start a new game with a new secret number.
